engineer specializing in distributed systems, mostly on the jvm</h4>
<p>With more than 20 years of experience in software engineering, I am
passionate about designing and implementing scalable, reliable, and
user-friendly solutions for complex business problems. I have a strong
background in cloud computing, microservices, data management, and
distributed systems, and I enjoy working with cutting-edge technologies
and frameworks. Currently, I am a Staff Engineer at Wayfair, one of the
world’s largest online destinations for home furnishings and decor.</p>
<p>At Wayfair, I lead the design and implementation for our Sales
customer master data management system, which tracks 800 million
customers worldwide. I also lead the design and architecture across 9
teams to address Wayfair’s larger technical transformation goals, which
include splitting functionality out of the monolith codebase and
database and moving towards a microservices architecture. I use GCP,
Java, Spring, Python to build and deploy robust and performant services
that support Wayfair’s fast-growing and diverse customer base. I also
mentor and collaborate with other engineers, product managers, and
stakeholders to ensure high-quality and timely delivery of features and
enhancements.</p>
